Timeography
This is a project that I have used to help learn openFrameworks as it is based on an idea I had many years ago. The primary intention is to create a new type of long exposure as, having been a photographer for some significant time,
currently if an area is bright at any point during the exposure then it will no longer capture information in that part of the image. This essentially produces a multiple exposure image from a video source with two distinct processes,
there is one process that builds the individual 'exposures' and then those exposures are layered upon one another with an algorithm that allows areas to be influenced by each exposure. Unfortunately I couldn't include the video files that
were used but there are several example and development images that are included in the bin/data folder. I also realised that I may be able to create images similar to www.xavibou.com who has created a beautiful series of images that
capture the flight of birds. The whole project needs to be better, for example it is clear that I need to make these two behaviour modes into some kind of class hierarchy and I also need to learn how to make a library from inputSelector that
I can share between projects but I do not know how to go about it at this stage (any simple tutorial would be greatly received btw!?)
I don't really want people to use this until I have produced a body of work and had a show but if you just want to play please do feel free (there's quite a bit of commenting that should see you through the process)
